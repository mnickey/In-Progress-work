Thank you for stopping by.
This is my portfolio of the work that I have done past and present. 

Coding is a love of mine so I hope you enjoy loking at this code as much as I have enjoyed writing it.

If you have any suggestions, comments or questions, please feel free to contact me. 

Thank you very much and have a wonderful day(night).

Regards,
